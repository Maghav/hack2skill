Backend Task 1

Fetch the data from two collections using joins from MongoDB with queue management in the least possible time and host the entire application and deploy it on Heroku.
The two collections are as follows:

MOCK-DATA-1.json - full_name, email, number, city, url
MOCK-DATA-2.json - full_name, email, team_name
Run a Node Server.
Add the two JSON files attached with the mail, to two different collections.
Write a query to fetch the list with Team Name, Full Name, Email, Number, City & URL.
Run the query with a single action button.
Display the query result in a tabular manner.
 
You are to deploy your code on Heroku and provide us the link, as well as provide us the link to the GitHub repository of your code. Use MongoDB as the database, and for the frontend, you are free to use anything as long as you are able to view the table data.
